## Bicycle Demand Prediction for Capital Bikeshare in Washington, D.C.

This project aims to build and train a regression model using the Capital Bike Share Kaggle dataset to predict the demand for bicycle rentals, based on time and weather, in the Washington, D.C. market. The goals for this project include:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis: Conduct an in-depth exploration of the dataset to gain insights into the variables and understand their relationships. This analysis will provide valuable information for feature selection and engineering.

2. Regression Model Training: Develop and train a regression model to predict the demand for bicycle rentals based on factors such as time and weather conditions. The model will capture the relationship between these variables and the number of bicycles rented at any given hour.

3. Iterative Model Optimization: Continuously refine and optimize the regression model by expanding or selecting relevant features that improve its performance. This iterative process ensures that the model captures the key factors driving bicycle demand accurately.

4. Regularization to Avoid Overfitting: Apply regularization techniques to the model to prevent overfitting and enhance its generalization capabilities. Regularization methods such as L1 or L2 regularization will be employed to find the right balance between model complexity and performance.

5. RMSLE Calculation: Evaluate the performance of the regression model by calculating the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) for both the training and validation sets. This metric provides a measure of the model's accuracy in predicting the demand for bicycle rentals.

Through this project, we aim to provide insights and a reliable model that Capital Bikeshare can use to estimate the number of bicycles needed at any given time based on weather conditions. The project code and results will be shared on GitHub, enabling collaboration and knowledge sharing with the data science community.
